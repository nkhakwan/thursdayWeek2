# KhanSahab submitting work for Week2 Thursday
### index.html brings up the site that would ask you to input your age and it calculates the insurance
### Scripts.js is the file i worked mostly today but all the code has been commented out except the one that supports index.html.
### Lots of practice and lots of frustrative moments in debugging the code. But i find browser's prompt an easy way to debug as compared to jsfiddle.
### Here it is loaded on gh-pages
